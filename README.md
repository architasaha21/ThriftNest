ThriftNest is your campus marketplace â€” *built by students, for students*. Whether you're moving out, upgrading, or just decluttering your hostel room, ThriftNest lets you sell your pre-loved books, gadgets, clothes, and more to fellow university mates. It's the easiest way to earn some extra cash while giving your stuff a second life. ðŸŒ±

Every trade on ThriftNest helps reduce waste and cut down on fast-consumption culture â€” making your wallet and the planet a little happier. Think of it as thrifting, but smarter, local, and student-powered.
